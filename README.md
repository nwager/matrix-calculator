# Matrix Calculator

This project was heavily inspired by the [Desmos Matrix Calculator](https://www.desmos.com/matrix). That site has been invaluable for my linear algebra tasks, but it only supports variables that are matrices. I added support for scalar variables that can work as elements in a matrix, or coefficients for an entire matrix.
